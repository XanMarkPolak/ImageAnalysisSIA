def find_objects_column_gaussian(image_in, k, mask=None):
    """
    Find objects using a Gaussian model.

    Description:
    Fit a Gaussian probability density function (pdf) to LineScan rows to create a background model.
    The pdf of every pixel in the LineScan camera scan (column in the image) is characterized by its mean and variance.
    The calculated mean and variance are used to transform each pixel into a standard scale with a mean of 0 and
    a standard deviation of 1. This standardized score allows us to assess how many standard deviations an
    individual pixel intensity is from the mean. A threshold, k, is used to separate the background and object.

    Usage:
    This function is used to create an initial object mask from a NIR (Near-Infrared) image. The resulting image contains
    values of 0 for the object and 1 for the background. This image can be used as a new object mask.

    Parameters:

    - image_in (numpy.ndarray): An image in NumPy array format loaded with OpenCV (cv2.imread) with dtype=uint8.
      The input image to be segmented into background (0) and objects (1).
    - k (float): The number of standard deviations a pixel must differ from the mean to be classified as an object.
    - mask (numpy.ndarray, optional): An optional parameter. If provided, this parameter is an image with 0 for objects
      and 1 for background. This mask image is used to "mask out" object pixels in the original image.

    Returns:

    - numpy.ndarray: A segmented binary image, where each pixel is identified as an object (0) or background (1).

    Example:
    >>> imgNIR = cv2.imread("LS-NIR-00001-0008-99999.png", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    >>> result = find_objects_column_gaussian(imgNIR, k)
    # 'result' now contains the segmented binary image.

    Fill holes in objects within an image using the cv2.floodFill method.

    This function takes an input image with objects that may contain holes and fills those holes.
    It begins by creating a flood-filled copy of the input image, then inverts it to produce a mask
    for the holes. Finally, it combines the input image with the inverted flood-filled image to fill
    the holes in the objects.

    Parameters:
    input_image (numpy.ndarray):
        The input image with objects that may contain holes (object = 255, background = 0).

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray:

    Adjust the intensity of each column in an image with a correction factor, while clipping values within a specified
    range.

    This function takes an input image and applies a correction to it along each column. The resulting values are
    clipped within the range defined by `clip_min` and `clip_max`. If any values go below `clip_min`, they
    are set to `clip_min`, and if any values exceed `clip_max`, they are set to `clip_max`.
    The corrected image is then cast back to uint8 data type.
    It is assumed that image and correction have equal width.

    Parameters:
    image (numpy.ndarray):
        The input image, represented as a NumPy array, with pixel intensities. It should be of data type uint8.

    correction (numpy.ndarray):
        The correction factor to be added to each column in the image. It should be of data type int16 to handle
        potential overflow issues.

    clip_min (int):
        The minimum value to which pixel intensities are clipped. It defines the lower bound of pixel values in
        the corrected image.

    clip_max (int):
        The maximum value to which pixel intensities are clipped. It defines the upper bound of pixel values in
        the corrected image.

    numpy.ndarray:
        An image with adjusted column-wise intensities, where values are clipped within the specified range, and
